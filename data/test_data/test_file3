Here you will find a deep library of writings, videos, podcasts, and more that feature the work of Dr. William Lane Craig. A great place to begin is our short animated video series below.

For a taste of Dr. Craig’s writing we have a section full of both popular-level articles for a general audience as well as academic articles that cover topics in greater depth.

Have a question? Dr. Craig responds to a weekly Question of the Week! You can use our Index to find a particular question or topic.  You can also submit a question of your own.

Looking for videos? You can find us on YouTube at DrCraigvideos, which features short clips, and at ReasonableFaithOrg which hosts full-length videos of Dr. Craig’s many debates, lectures, and weekly Defenders Class.
